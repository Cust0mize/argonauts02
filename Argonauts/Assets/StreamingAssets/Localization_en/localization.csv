cutscene_1_1,"The morning at the Argonauts agency began as usual â€“ quiet and steady. Jason and Medea were counting up their takings for the week, when suddenlyâ€¦ The door opened with a crash, and a man bandaged up like an Egyptian mummy came in head over heels, his crutches flying. A miniature stormcloud hung over the uninvited guest's head, releasing a downpour."
cutscene_1_2,"The surprise visitor turned out to be the artifact collector Pelias, a man not unknown in the town, and an honorary uncle of Medea. After struggling to his feet, Pelias begged for help and literally dragged the friends to his mansion."
cutscene_1_3,"On the way to the mansion, Pelias said that while digging around in his storeroom, he happened to drop a box, and then he started having serious trouble. Jason and Medea could see how much trouble once they arrived. A snowstorm raged on one side of the mansion, and a thunderstorm on the other. Part of the mansion had been destroyed by a meteor shower."
cutscene_1_4,"After fighting their way through to the storeroom, Jason and Medea examined the box that Pelias dropped. The label read ""Pandora's Box"", and lower down, ""DO NOT OPEN!"" Now they could all see where all Pelias' trouble had come from."
cutscene_1_5,"After a discussion, our heroes decided to go to the oracle to find out how to drive the pandemonium back into Pandora's box and close it."
,
cutscene_2_1,"Finally, Jason and Medea reached the oracle's house. At first glance, neither the old man nor his dilapidated tower made them feel as if an oracle stood before them. But there was no choice, and our heroes told the oracle about the open Pandora's Box and the disaster wrought on Pelias."
cutscene_2_2,"According to the oracle, in order to return all Pelias' troubles to Pandora's Box and lock them away, many good deeds must be done. And the oracle was so kind as to provide a list of deeds, starting with ""...Restore the oracle's towerâ€¦"" Our heroes could do nothing but roll up their sleeves and start working through the tasks on the list."
,
cutscene_3_1,"As Jason and Medea suspected, the list of good deeds had nothing to do with Pandora's Box. The old man was just using them. But the oracle calmed the angered friends. He told them that Pandora's Box cannot be closed, and the troubles will follow only the one who possesses the box. This meant that all that need be done was to send the box to Aid's kingdom, where it would do nobody any harm."
cutscene_3_2,"The oracle told the friends how to get to the entrance to Aid's kingdom. The entrance was in deep caves far in the mountains. To send Pandora's Box there, two portals had to be constructed: one at the entrance to Aid's kingdom, the other at Pelias' house. Crystals had to be put in the portalsâ€¦ It all sounds so simpleâ€¦"
,
cutscene_4_1,"Jason and Medea finally reached the entrance to the caves. They heard the voices of shadows and ghosts that promised them terrible suffering. There was a moment when our heroes almost turned back, but then they overcame their fears and bravely strode onward..!"
,
cutscene_5_1,"After getting out of the caves on the other side of the mountain range, our heroes went home to set up the portal at Pelias' house. By all appearances, Pandora's Box was bringing more and more trouble. While the friends were travelling, a drought struck, and the green plain turned into a desert. Hordes of monsters filled the area and drew closer and closer to Pelias' house."
,
cutscene_6_1,"Pandora's Box, as if alive, was resisting the journey to Aid's kingdom. All the power of the elements descended on Jason. Wind howled and tried to bowl the hero over, rain poured into his eyes to stop him seeing where he put his feet. But none of it worked, and Jason managed to reach the portal anyway."
cutscene_6_2,"It worked! Jason threw Pandora's Box into the portal! That very moment, all the monsters disappeared, the stormcloud evaporated from above Pelias' head, and all the weather anomalies fled his home. And long-awaited silence descendedâ€¦"
cutscene_6_3,"Throughout all the trouble, Pelias' entire household fled all over the district. They couldn't return, since the monsters were still there wandering the plain. Pelias asked our heroes to find his household and bring them home. Our friends agreed to help."
,
cutscene_7_1,Jason and Medea managed to return Pelias' frightened household to the mansion. They all quickly repaired it. Peace and quiet was finally hereâ€¦
cutscene_7_2,"But what's this?! A new box has arrived at Pelias' house! It didn't take long for his household to scatter, and our friends all cried ""What?! Again?!!""â€¦"

He asked for help in solving a problem with one of his artifacts. As it turned out, Pelias had accidentally opened Pandora's Box in his storeroom. Now a real cataclysm was forming above his home, and picking up speed, and Pelias himself was being followed by all the trouble and disaster of the world.
